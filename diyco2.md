## Target

- BIO CO2 plant
  - I like the challenge ^^
  - plant will be regulateable
  - 5 l cannister as CO2 plant
  - will be fed slow stream of sugar solution drops
  - sugar-supply will be shut on before morning and shut off before noon
  - feeding mechanism: dosing Pump with Reef-Pi
  - overpressure valve (adjusted to limit the CO2 supply if anything goes wrong)
  - check valve
  - 2 x 0,5l washer bottles
- Inline reactor
  - 2 PET bottles, glued together back to back, filled with Bio-balls
  - both end have the bottle cap with a 16/22mm hose connector
  - water flows downwards, CO2 bubbles want to go up and stay inside until dissolved
  - placed in filter inlet (straight line -> more flow)
  - placed in filter outlet (needs curve -> less flow, but safer for the filter)
