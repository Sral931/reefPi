- **Current Status: slow Step-by-Step buildup**

1. [Target](#target)
2. [Progress](#progress)

## Target

- Tropic fresh water Aquarium
- basically [this template from JBL](https://www.jbl.de/?mod=areas&func=essential_section&country=us&lang=en&id=36)
  - planned out (no personal aquarium knowledge)
  - scaled from 120l to 200l
- water values
  - T ~ 25Â°C
  - CH ~ 4-5 dCH
  - ph < 7.0
  - CO2 ~ 20mg/l
- medium fast growing plants (as far as I understand)
- Fish
  - 20-30 Neon tetra
  - 3 Cockatoo dwarf cichlid
  - 15-20 Golden pencil fish
  - 6-9 three line catfish (or similar)
  - 10-15 golden oto (or similar)
- BIO CO2 plant
  - I like the challenge ^^
  - plant will be regulateable
  - 5 l cannister as CO2 plant
  - will be fed slow stream of sugar solution drops
  - sugar-supply will be shut on before morning and shut off before noon
  - feeding mechanism: dosing Pump with Reef-Pi ?
  - overpressure valve (adjusted to limit the CO2 supply if anything goes wrong)
  - check valve
  - 2 x 0,5l washer bottles
- Inline reactor
  - 2 PET bottles, glued together back to back, filled with Bio-balls
  - both end have the bottle cap with a 16/22mm hose connector
  - water flows downwards, CO2 bubbles want to go up and stay inside until dissolved
  - placed in filter inlet (straight line -> more flow)
  - placed in filter outlet (needs curve -> less flow, but safer for the filter)

## Progress
