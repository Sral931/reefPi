# Sral's Aquarium and Reef-Pi Project

Overview of Sral's Aquarium and Reef-Pi Build. Includes planning and progress reports.

Current Stage:
   - **Aquarium: build-up**
      - next: pipes and ground
   - **DIY CO2 Plant: testing**
      - next: test CO2 production and dissolution in reactor
   - **Reef-Pi : install+test main Pi unit**
      - next: burn image to SD card
   - **DIY EC Sensor: testing**
      - next: build test circuit
   - **DIY PWM Dimmer: waiting for parts**
      - next: build test circuit
