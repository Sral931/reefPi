Overview of Sral's Aquarium and Reef-Pi Build. Includes planning and progress reports.

Current Stage:
   - **Aquarium: build-up**
      - next: pipes and ground
   - **DIY CO2 Plant: waiting for parts**
      - next: mechanical reinforcement on seals
   - **Reef-Pi : waiting for parts**
      - next: set up Main Pi unit
   - **DIY EC Sensor: waiting for parts**
      - next: build test circuit
